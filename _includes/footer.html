            <h3>I'm a bit of an alien but I have an open mind and I love a good challenge. My design practice and experience spans across multiple disciplines because I enjoy the flexibility of being able to do all the things and evolving alongside new technologies, most recently in the areas of full-stack development and 3D. I&apos;ve spent the last 4 years freelancing and starting DIY non-for-profit projects within my local arts, music and film community in Meanjin Brisbane. Fostering underground culture and community is at the centre of what I love to do. I am also a ceramic artist making one-of-a-kind lamps under the moniker Queena Grot and play in a punk band called Guppy.

            <p>To recognise that I live, work and benefit from systems built on stolen Jagera and Turrbal country is an important step towards true reconcilliation with First Nations people, the traditional owners of this land. Without recognition of their wisdom and eternal connection to country we risk being stuck in cycles of the past and never truly moving forward together with the kind of grace that would benefit everyone in this country and is worth fighting for.</p>
