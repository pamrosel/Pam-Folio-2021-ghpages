    <p>To embody their responsive work to the Noosa landscape and surrounds, I worked with Bark to design their new brand identity and a website to highlight their public and private architectural projects. Each project tells a story, incorporating initial sketches, plot stats, blueprints and writings with the final work beautifully realised and photographed.
