    <p>It was very special to work with the behemoth creative that is Urban Art Projects. Together we made a website that celebrated their vibrant and extensive folio of public works around the world. The end result was an absolute beast of a site, carefully indexing tonnes of content showcasing their builds and collaborators, also available in Mandarin for their growing international operations.
