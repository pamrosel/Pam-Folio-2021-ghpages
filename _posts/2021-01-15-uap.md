    <p>It was so special to work with the creative behemoth that is UAP. They came to us needing a brand refresh and a website that celebrated their vibrant and extensive folio of public art projects around the world, even requiring multi-lingual site capabilities for their new operations in Shanghai. Their projects were categorised under the branches: Studio, Factory and Supply, searchable & sortable via a multi-filter system. Individual works within the Supply collection, like public furniture, could be specified for a quote request sent internally from the site. The end result was an absolute beast of a site, carefully indexing tonnes of content, gorgeously documented Urban Art Projects and their many international artist collaborators.
