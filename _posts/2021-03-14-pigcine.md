    A personal project that curated a collection of all the unusual films playing across Brisbane in one online space as a resource that could increase awareness and attendance at these under-publicised events and hopefully build a stronger community amongst film goers. In partnership with MetroArts, we went on to host free film screenings featuring the work of both local and international film makers. The project lost steam with the advent of covid-19.</p>
