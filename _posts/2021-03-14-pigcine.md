    <p>PIG CINÉ was a non-for-profit project that started with the idea of listing the unusual screening events across Brisbane in the one place to bring local cinephiles together and increase attendance at the variety of these otherwise under-publicised events. The website featured listed screenings by order of what was playing next, deleting screenings once they'd played - filterable by what film program it was part of or even what venue it was playing at. In partnership with MetroArts, we also hosted free film screenings featuring the work of both local and international film makers.
